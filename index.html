        <p>& Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
    <h2>A Little Bit About Me!</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Alexander M. I am a 4th year ITM major. I transferred from community college. I still have a good amount of time left at IIT to fufill credit requirments. 
            I am excited to learn some fundamentals of web design. I also am excited to get more familiar with github and the interesting things you can do with the tool. 
            I have lived in Chicago for a majority of my life. I have two cats who's names are Mr. Robot and Pi. I also have a dog named Moose. This summer I mostly picked up extra hours at my job.
            In my free time I would work on restoring my car and hanging out with friends. This semester I hope to focus on refining my resume and getting an internship.
